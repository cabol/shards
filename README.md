> ### ETS tables on steroids!
> Sharding for ETS tables out-of-box.

Why might we need **Sharding/Partitioning** for the ETS tables? The main reason
is to keep the lock contention under control enabling ETS tables to scale out
and support higher levels of concurrency without lock issues; specially
write-locks, which most of the cases might cause significant performance
degradation.

Therefore, one of the most common and proven strategies to deal with these
problems is [Sharding][sharding] or [Partitioning][partitioning]; the principle
is pretty similar to [DHTs][dht].

This is where [shards][shards] comes in. [shards][shards] is an Erlang/Elixir
library fully compatible with the [ETS API][ets_api], but it implements sharding
or partitioning on top of the ETS tables, completely transparent and out-of-box.

See the **[getting started][getting_started]** guide
and the **[online documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/shards/)**.

## Installation

### Erlang

In your `rebar.config`:

```erlang
{deps, [
  {shards, "0.6.2"}
]}.
```

### Elixir

In your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:shards, "~> 0.6"}]
end
```

> For more information and examples, see the [getting started][getting_started]
  guide.

## Testing

```
$ make test
```

You can find tests results in `_build/test/logs`, and coverage in
`_build/test/cover`.

> **NOTE:** `shards` comes with a helper `Makefile`, but it is just a simple
  wrapper on top of `rebar3`, therefore, you can do everything using `rebar3`
  directly as well (e.g.: `rebar3 do ct, cover`).

## Generating Edoc

```
$ make docs
```

> **NOTE:** Once you run the previous command, you will find the generated HTML
  documentation within `doc` folder; open `doc/index.html`.
